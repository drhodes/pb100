      <p>
        In this recitation we will explore induction. You may have
        noticed that the book and lectures have defined natural
        numbers starting from `1`. In contrast, the Lean MathLib nats
        start at `0`. That's ok, we can work around it!

        But, no need to worry, we'll clear up these differences as they arise.

        Beyond working with the built in <code> induction </code>
        tactic, first we'll implement induction from scratch without
        the tactic, starting on the next page. So, put on your
        recursion hat!
