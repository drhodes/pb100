There are a few symbols that are super helpful to know as a shorthand,
and will be used throughout the course. Let \(S \) be a set.  Then:

| Symbol           | Meaning                             |
|   -------------: | : -----                             |
| \( a\in S \)     | \( a \) is an element in \( S \)    |
| \( a\notin S \)  | \( a \) is \( \underline{not} \) an element in \(S\) |
| \( \forall \)    | for all. (or for each)              |
|  :=              | define                              |
| \( \exists \)    | there exists                        |
| \( \exists! \)   | there exists a unique               |
| \( \implies \)   | implies                             |
| \( \iff \)       | if and only if                      |
| \( \land \)      | logical 'and'                       |
| \( \lor \)       | logical 'or'                        |
