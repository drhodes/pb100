    <p>
      This course is derived from the 18.100A: Real Analysis material
      developed by the MIT math department during the Covid pandemic
      in 2020. The lectures were given
      by <a href="https://tarheels.live/crodriguez/">Casey
      Rodriguez</a>, who is now an assistant professor at UNC at
      Chapel Hill.

      MIT OpenCourseWare hosts the

        material</a>, including video lectures, lecture notes,

      This course is a remix of 18.100A. It includes additional
      exercises and solutions that use the Lean4 proof assistant.
      This means we now have a way to learn real analysis on our own
      and still be confident that the proofs we build are correct.

      However, if you are just getting started with proving in lean,
      then you should definitely start with the following browser

      This course uses some free books. The primary text is:<br/>
      <a href="https://www.jirka.org/ra/realanal.pdf">Basic Analysis I</a>, version 6.0, by Jiří Lebl.
      <br/><br/>

      Some recommended readings will be selected from:

    <p> As for installing the lean proof assistent ..
      <i>Hey! Wait a second!  You already have it installed, right?!</i> AHEM,
      (please see prerequisites). You really need to work through
      those prereqs because this course builds on those skills and
      simultaneously introduces real analysis.

      If you're ready, then it's time to sharpen your pencils and
      keyboards, grab some toast and a hot beverage.
