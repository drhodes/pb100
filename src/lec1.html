    <h4> The three main goals of this course are: </h4>

    <ul>
      <li> Gain experience with proofs. </li>
      <li> Have fun proving statements about real numbers, functions, and limits. </li>
      <li> Formalize proofs in the Lean proof assistant..
        (it's more addictive than <a href="https://github.com/TwoFX/sudoku">sudoku</a> - really!)
      </li>      
    </ul>

    <hr/>
    <p> Examples of proofs found in industry today (todo: need more examples) </p>
    
    <div>
      <b> Finance </b> researchers who employ strategies that depend on
      probability would like to know their calculations are
      meaningful and accurate. This course will prepare you for
      understanding metric spaces which serves as the modern
      foundation of probability and statistics. Some examples:

        <b> Encryption </b> is woven through every part of our online world to
        ensure the security of customers, nations and personal
        communication. Without proofs from number theory, we could not
        trust software to keep our secrets safe.
      </div>

      
    <p>
      Proof assistants such as Lean verify our reasoning with
      unparalleled guarantees without relying on peer review. The
      quick feedback loop helps keep learners on track.

      Before getting into that, let's hear about the subject at hand.

      A <term>set</term> is a collection of objects called
      elements or members of that set. The <term>empty set</term>
      (denoted `\emptyset`) is the set with no elements.

    <p>
      For comparing sets `A` and `B`, here are some common definitions
      with notation.
    </p>

    <definition>
      The set `A` is a <term>subset</term> of `B`, if every element of `A` is in `B`.
      \[ A \subset B \quad \text{if} \quad  a \in A \implies a \in B. \]
    </definition>
    
    <definition>
      `A` and `B` are <term>equal</term>, `\ A = B`, if `A \subset B` and `B \subset A `.
    </definition>
    
    <definition>
      The set `A` is a <term>proper subset</term> of `B`, `A\subsetneq B` if `A \subset B` and `A\neq B`.

  <page title="Anatomy of implication">
    <p>
      It is good to have a strong understanding of logical
      implication, and how it differs from its use in every day
      language. The more comfort you have with this idea, the easier
      it will be to understand <term>induction</term> when it is
      introduced.
    </p>

    <p> Here are two resources that are well worth reading <br/>

      2.3: Implications by Harris Kwong
    </a>
    </p>
    
    <hr></hr>
    <center><h2><term> Suppose you are a bomb technician. </term></h2></center>
    
    <p>
      You are at a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site">
        Nevada test site</a>, standing directly under a nuclear weapon.
    </p>
   

    <fig fname="unit1/nuclear-bomb-technician.png" text="A technician inspects a control panel"/>
   
    <p> Please consider the following: </p>
    
    <center-box>
      "If <bu> the bomb explodes </bu> then <bu>you will die instantly</bu>"
    </center-box>
    
    That statement is designed to be memorable, irrefutable and has
    the form:

    \[ A \implies B \]

    <hr></hr>

	<p>
      One might ask about different forms of implication using the
      same terms. Firstly, what about swapping the positions of `A`
      and `B`? Let's see.
    </p>
	
    <p>
      The <term>converse</term> of `A \implies B \quad` is `\quad B \implies A`
    </p>
    
    <center-box>
      "if <bu>you died instantly</bu> then <bu>the bomb exploded</bu>"
    </center-box>

    <p> <i>Maybe.</i> But, that's not necessarily true. Suppose that you did die at the
      test site.  Consider that the bomb's detonator is controlled by
      professionals who are not influenced by your health. Your death
      could have been a coincidence, you could have had a heart attack
      or a stroke. The point is, your death did not cause the bomb to
      explode, which is what the <term>converse</term> is implying. </p>
    
    <hr></hr>
    <p>The <term> inverse </term> of `A \implies B \quad` is `\quad \neg A \implies \neg B`</p>

    <center-box>
      "If <bu>the bomb does <term>not</term> explode</bu> then <bu>
        you will <term> not </term> die instantly </bu>."
    </center-box>
    
    <p>
      Is that necessarily true? No, there is still a chance you could
      drop dead under the undetonated bomb, for some other unrelated
      reason.
    </p>

    <hr/>
    
    The <term> contrapositive </term> of `A \implies B \quad` is `\quad \neg B \implies \neg A`
    
    <center-box>
      "if <bu>you do <term>not</term> die instantly</bu> then <bu>the bomb did <term>not</term> explode</bu>"
    </center-box>
    
    <p> Is that necessarily true? YES! Since you're still standing
      there, then the bomb most definitely did not explode! </p>

  <page title="Set builder notation">
    
    <vid1 desc="Set builder notation" start="00:09:56" end="00:14:42" />

    <p> Set-builder notation is the name of a method used to descibe
    sets. We write </p>

    \[ \{x \in A \mid P(x)\} \quad \text{or} \quad \{x\mid P(x)\} \]

    <p>
      to mean "all `x \in A` that satisfies property `P(x)`". One example of
      this would be,
      
      \[ \{ x \mid x\ \text{is an even number} \}. \]

      There are a few key 
      sets that we will use throughout this class:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> `\mathbb{N}`, The set of natural numbers: `\{1,2,3,4,\dots\}` </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Now would be a good time to note that this course is derived
      from material with the convention that natural numbers start at
      1. In contrast, the Lean Mathlib has natural numbers that start
      at 0. This course will provide good practice with working
      between the two, so please be aware of the difference.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> `\mathbb{Z}`, The set of integers: `\{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, \dots\}` </li>
      <li> `\mathbb{Q}`, The set of rational numbers: `\{\frac{m}{n} \mid m,n\in \mathbb{Z} \land n\neq 0\}` </li>
      <li> `\mathbb{R}`, The set of real numbers. </li>

    <proof desc="">
      <p>
        Let `B`, `C` be sets.  We are proving,

        \[ ( B \cup C )^c = (B^c \cap C^c) \]

        Start by rewriting the equality in terms of its definition,
        
        \[
        (B \cup C)^c \subset ( B^c \cap C^c )
        \quad \text{and} \quad
        (B^c \cap C^c)^c \subset ( B \cup C )^c
        \]
      </p>

      
      <p>For the first inclusion, show that `(B \cup C)^c \subset ( B^c \cap C^c ) `. </p>

      <p>
        let `x \in (B \cup C)^c `, then:

        <align>
          x \notin B \cup C &\implies x \notin B \land x \notin C \\
          &\implies x \in B^c \land x \in C^c \\
          &\implies x \in B^c \cap C^c
        </align>

        Thus, ` (B \cup C)^c \subset (B^c \cap C^c) `
      </p>

      <p> For the second inclusion, we want to show that ` (B^c \cap C^c) \subset ( B \cup C )^c `. </p>
      
      <p>
        let `x \in B^c \cap C^c `, then:

        <align>
          x \in B^c \land c \in C^c &\implies x \notin B \land x \notin C \\
          &\implies x \notin (B \cup C) \\
          &\implies x \in (B \cup C)^c \\
        </align>

        Thus, ` B^c \cap C^c \subset (B \cup C)^c `.

        <hr/>
        So having proved both inclusions,

        \[ ( B \cup C )^c = B^c \cap C^c \quad \]

        We've proven the base case `P(1)`. Next the goal is to prove that `P(m)

        Here is one way to do it in Lean. Please note that since
        natural numbers in Lean start at zero, the hypotheses <code>(hn : 0 < n)</code>
        is included to compensate.

        We can assume the left side `P(m)` because the base case is
        already proved. That is part of the trick and it might seem
        like something is missing, but consider that once the base
        case `P(1)` is proved, then `P(2)` is true since `P(1)
        \implies P(2)` is true. And - that is true because `P(m)
        \implies P(m+1)` is true for all `m`, including `m=1`.
      </p>
      
      <p> The induction step gives us a proof of `P` for any `m+1`, as
        long as `P` is proved for `m`. But what if `P` not proved for
        `m`? Aha! In that case, ensure `P` is proved for `m-1`, and so
        on, following the chain back to the base case, which will need
        to be proved somehow.

        Let's take a look at the logic underpinning the overall
        reasoning here, in four steps to determine the truth of the
        implication.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term> Step 1 </term>: Establish the implication
        
        \[ P(m) \implies P(m+1) \]

        <term> Step 2 </term>: Assume `P(m)` because it will be rooted
        in the base case.
        
        \[ \text{True} \implies P(m+1) \]

        <term> Step 3 </term>: The inductive step shows that no matter
        which `P(m)` is true, the next, `P(m+1)` is also true. So,
        since the base case `P(1)` is proven to be true, the inductive
        step is used to assert `P(2)`.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Next, since `P(2)` is now proven to be true as well, the
        inductive step is used again to assert `P(3)`, and so on,
        forever.
        
        \[ \text{True} \implies \text{True} \]

        <term> step 4 </term>: From formal logic, the truth table:

        <center>
          <table style="width:25%; text-align: center">
            <tr> <th> `a` </th> <th> `b` </th> <th> `a \implies b` </th> </tr>
            <tr> <td> `T` </td> <td> `T` </td> <td> `T` </td> </tr>
            <tr> <td> `T` </td> <td> `F` </td> <td> `F` </td> </tr>
            <tr> <td> `F` </td> <td> `T` </td> <td> `T` </td> </tr>
            <tr> <td> `F` </td> <td> `F` </td> <td> `T` </td> </tr>
          </table>
        </center>
        
        \[ \underbrace{ \text{True} \implies \text{True} }_{\text{entire implication evaluates to True}}  \]

        <align>
          P(1) \implies P(2) \implies P(2) \implies \cdots \implies P(n-1) &\implies P(n) \\
          \text{True} \implies P(2) \implies P(3) \implies \cdots \implies P(n-1) &\implies P(n)  \\
          \text{True} \implies P(3) \implies \cdots \implies P(n-1) &\implies P(n) \\
          \text{True} \implies \cdots \implies P(n-1) &\implies P(n) \\
          \text{True} \implies P(n-1) &\implies P(n) \\
          \text{True} &\implies P(n) \\
          & \text{True} \\
        </align>
        
        By induction, `\forall n, P(n)` holds `\quad \square`
