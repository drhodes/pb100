Your definition of card_lt is not correct.

It is not good enough to say that there is an injection that is not a
bijection.

You have to say there is an injection, and there is no function that
is a bijection.

For example, consider the function ff from the natural numbers to the
natural numbers defined by f(n)=n+1f(n)=n+1.

That function is an injection but not a bijection, so by your
definition you would end up concluding that the natural numbers are
smaller than themselves, which is wrong.

Also, there is a slight technicality concerning the empty set.

Suppose α is a nonempty type and β is an empty type.

Then there is no function from α to β. But the empty sets of those two
types should have the same cardinality. The problem is caused by the
fact that you use functions f : α → β, so f must assign a value to
every object of type α--even those that are not elements of A, so
values are not needed for them. As long as β is nonempty it is
possible to assign those values, so there won't be a problem. But if
you try to prove theorems about cardinality using your definitions,
occasionally you may run into situations in which you need to add a
hypothesis that β is nonempty.

In How To Prove It with Lean, I took a similar approach, but I used
relations rather than functions to avoid this technicality concerning
unneeded values. Cardinalities are covered in Chapter 8.  The proof of
Cantor's theorem is at the end of Section 8.2.
