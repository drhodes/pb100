The overall crux: Lots of math is based on sets, lean uses types. Sets
are not types and types are not sets, but their shadows are
entangled. So what's the problem?

The irritation starts with injectivity, surjectivity and
cardinality. I'm going to pick on Lebl's Basic analysis because that's
the book I have. Talking about the definition of set image:

\\[ Definition 0.3.13 Consider a function $f : A \to B$ ... \\]

Ok, great. That's familiar - a function from type A to type B. Except,
no, sorry. $A$ and $B$ are sets. No problem, then to translate, we
have 

\\[ f : Set A \to Set B \\]

Right? No. because the definition has:

\\[ f(C) := {f(x) \in B: c \in C} \\]

As is plainly written, $f$ applies to the C, and also the elements of
the set C. This notation is hazardous.

A direct image of C, where C is a subset of A is a function of sets.





Why? It doesn't matter, that notation really has to change. I'm going
to



Anyways, the horror continues. In the book, injections are defined in
terms of sets, yet the definition of Injection in lean has nothing to
do with sets at all, which is good, because the
